# eXplainable Machine Learning / Wyjaśnialne Uczenie Maszynowe - 2023

[**eXplainable Machine Learning**](https://usosweb.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&kod=1000-319bEML) course for Machine Learning (MSc) studies at the University of Warsaw. 

Winter semester 2022/23 [@pbiecek](https://github.com/pbiecek) [@hbaniecki](https://github.com/hbaniecki)


## Design Principles

The course consists of lectures, computer labs and a project.

The design of this course is based on four principles:

- Mixing experiences during studies is good. It allows you to generate more ideas. Also, in mixed groups, we can improve our communication skills,
- In eXplainable AI (XAI), the interface/esthetic of the solution is important. Like earlier Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), XAI is on the borderline between technical, domain and cognitive aspects. Therefore, apart from the purely technical descriptions, the results must be grounded in the domain and should be communicated aesthetically and legibly. 
- Communication of results is important. Both in science and business, it is essential to be able to present the results concisely and legibly. In this course, it should translate into the ability to describe one XAI challenge in the form of a short report/article.
- It is worth doing valuable things. Let's look for new applications for XAI methods discussed on typical predictive problems.
